This is a skeleton for BoofCV based vision projects. Provides a Gradle script to build and a "Hello World" example.
The build script will download all dependencies automatically.

Recommendations:
- IntelliJ for IDE
- Linux, Windows, or OSX

Useful Commands
- './gradlew assemble' to compile the project
- './gradlew HelloWorldJar' to create the HelloWorld jar
- 'java -jar HelloWorld.jar' to launch the jar. Provided so that you can test without an IDE.
